# Labyrinth

## Repository Overview

This repository houses three distinct projects created in 2023, which were initially developed without version control and later added to this repository. Each project is centered around a simple labyrinth game where the objective is for the player to navigate and escape the maze. These projects are implemented using different frameworks in C#: Windows Forms, WPF, and MAUI.

Each project follows an **event-driven** development paradigm, leveraging either **Model-View (MV)** or **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** architectures for structured design. They have undergone unit testing to ensure functionality and reliability.

## Key Features

- **Windows Forms:** Classic desktop application framework.
- **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation):** Rich, modern desktop application framework.
- **MAUI (Multi-platform App UI):** Cross-platform framework for building native apps.

## Documentation

Each project includes comprehensive documentation and UML diagrams to aid in understanding their structure and design.
